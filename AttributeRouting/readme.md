# Books widget
The following sample demonstrates a simple MVC Books widget displaying a list of books and book details on the front-end, and tracks points for each book that are retrieved, on the client.
The goal of this sample is to demonstrate:
1. How [attribute routing](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2013/10/17/attribute-routing-in-asp-net-mvc-5.aspx) can be used in the context of Sitefinity widgets.
2. How to leverage the Sitefinity CMS SEO and OpenGraph functionality with Feather widgets for displaying richer content in social media.

The code sample is described in details in our Sitefinity documentation [Feather: Create a Book widget](http://docs.sitefinity.com/feather-create-a-book-widget).
